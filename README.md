# Test Driven Development

What is TDD?

It is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to tet cases before software is fully developed.

This allows for fewer bugs and errors arising. which in term means less time is being spent of fixing such bugs, compared to other programming methodologies. Produces overall a higher test coverage and therefore to a better quality of the final product.
